eyeFiles is the oneye file manager. From eyeFiles you can upload your files and documents from your hard drive to oneye, move and manage them between different instances of the application, and launch a wide variety of files to be reproduced/shown with each specific application.

To launch eyeFiles, just click on the Home icon on your Desktop or open File Manager in the Office menu at eyeDock.

Once you are on the application, you will see three zones:
[list][*]The left bar with the common Actions and Places.
[*]A top bar with the current path. You can use it to navigate by text trough your Home space. Note that if you are root you will be able to navigate trough the whole oneye virtual file system.
[*]The files space, where you will see all the files and folders inside your current directory (by default, your Home directory). [/list]
