If you click on "New folder" or "New file" actions, a dialog will pop up. On that dialog you just have to type the name of the folder or of the file.

If you create a new file, you should add an extension. For a list of extensions go to the [goto=/Actions/Open and Open with]"Open and Open with"[/goto] document.
